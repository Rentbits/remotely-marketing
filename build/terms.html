<li><p>Additional Services. The Customer may have the option to activate certain additional services for the applicable Resident Users on the Remotely App, including without limitation online rent payment, maintenance requests, and tenant notifications. In the event that the C-storeustomer elects to add online rent payment to the Service provided to their applicable Residents, all payments are processed through this third party service (see <a href="http://www.paylease.com">www.paylease.com</a>). Remotely accepts ACH and credit card payments, and Remotely collects all the relevant information and passes it on to PayLease. Remotely does not store any of this payment information on its servers. (PayLease gives Remotely a token which Remotely can use to access payment histories if needed, but at no point can Remotely recover any Resident’s actual account information.) The Customers and their applicable Residents using PayLease may not conduct any chargebacks or other disputes which result in a loss for Remotely. Chargebacks that do not result in any loss for Remotely may be done, but only where such actions are not unlawful (unsubstantiated chargebacks, for example, may be fraudulent and constitute a crime in most, if not all, jurisdictions).</p></li>

</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Disclaimers of Warranties; Equipment.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Disclaimers of Warranties. EXCEPT FOR ANY WARRANTIES EXPLICITLY MADE BY REMOTELY TO CUSTOMERS IN THE SERVICE AGREEMENT AND TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REMOTELY MAKES NO WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE, THE SYSTEM, THE APP, THE SITE AND ALL MATERIALS RELATED THERETO, AND DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, QUIET ENJOYMENT, ACCURACY, NON-INFRINGEMENT OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

THE OWNER&rsquo;S MANUAL FOR EACH EQUIPMENT COMPONENT CONTAINS VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION SUCH AS OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS AND EQUIPMENT TESTING AND MAINTENANCE INFORMATION. THE CUSTOMER SHOULD ALSO READ ALL INSTRUCTIONS, WARNINGS AND OTHER INFORMATION ON THE EQUIPMENT ITSELF.</p></li>
<li><p>Battery Powered Devices. Some of the Equipment components in the Remotely System, including without limitation motion detectors, thermostats, smart locks and moisture detector, may not be designed to be connected to the electrical system of the designated Rental Community residential units, and such detection sensors require batteries to operate.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Service Agreement (including in these General Terms) or otherwise, and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Remotely and any of its Remotely Related Parties will not be liable with respect to any subject matter of the Service Agreement under any contract, negligence, strict liability or other legal or equitable theory for (i) any amounts in excess of the Fees paid to Remotely by the Customer, (ii) any direct, indirect, special, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, however caused, (iii) any damages for lost profits or lost data, (iv) any cost of procurement of substitute goods, technology or services, (v) any lost or damaged property, loss of use of property or any applicable Rental Community, or governmental fines and charges, (vi) any damages from any failures or disruptions, untimely delivery, scheduled or unscheduled, intentional or unintentional, preventing access to the Remotely Site temporarily or permanently, or (vii) any damages incurred in any manner by the Residents at any applicable Rental Community in which Customer has requested Service hereunder or any other claims of third parties.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation on Scope of Service. THE CUSTOMER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT NEITHER REMOTELY NOR ANY OF ITS REMOTELY RELATED PARTIES, IS AN INSURER OF OR AGAINST, OR LIABLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL LOSS OR DAMAGE TO PERSON OR PROPERTY THAT MAY OCCUR IN OR AT ANY OF THE APPLICABLE RENTAL COMMUNITIES, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF BURGLARY, THEFT, FIRE, SMOKE, CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING, WATER LEAKAGE, INSTALLATION, SELF-INSTALLATION, OPERATION, MAINTENANCE OR REMOVAL OF THE SYSTEM, PHYSICAL HARM TO ANY PERSON, ENTRY IN OR ONTO ANY OF THE APPLICABLE RENTAL COMMUNITIES, THE CONDUCT OF ANY PERSONS IN OR ON ANY OF THE APPLICABLE RENTAL COMMUNITIES, THE PROVISION OF THE SERVICES, OR OTHERWISE. THE CUSTOMER UNDERSTANDS AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE REMOTELY SERVICE IS NOT A THIRD PARTY MONITORED EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION SYSTEM AND THAT REMOTELY DOES NOT MONITOR EMERGENCY NOTIFICATIONS AND WILL NOT DISPATCH EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES TO ANY OF THE APPLICABLE RENTAL COMMUNITIES IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY, WITH RESPECT TO THE FOREGOING, REMOTELY EXPRESSLY DENIES AND DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE WHICH MAY OCCUR PRIOR TO, AT OR AFTER SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT. THIS INCLUDES LIABILITY BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE OF ANY DEGREE, WARRANTY (INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE) AND ALL OTHER THEORIES OF LIABILITY.</p></li>
<li><p>Limitation on Third Party Services and Products. Remotely is not responsible for any services, equipment, infrastructure, or content that is not provided by Remotely (even if it is a component of the Service, System, App and/or Site), and Remotely shall have no liability with respect to such services, equipment, infrastructure, or content, or with respect to the performance or non-performance of any such third party providers. Remotely does not endorse or warrant any third party services, products, or content that are distributed by or advertised through the Service. In addition, Remotely is not responsible for any failure on the part of a payment processor, including PayPal or any credit card company or bank that the Customer uses to fund PayPal, to direct payments to the correct destination, or any actions on their part in placing a hold on the Customer’s funds.</p></li>
<li><p>Delays; Service Interruptions. Remotely has no responsibility or liability to the Customer or any other person for delays in the installation or repair of the System or performance of the Service, regardless of the reason, or for any resulting consequences. Remotely has no responsibility or liability for interruptions of the Service, or any resulting consequences, whether due to Force Majeure or for any cause beyond Remotely&rsquo;s control. During any such Service interruption, Remotely has no obligation to supply the Customer with substitute services.</p></li>
<li><p>For Jurisdictions Restricting Contractual Limitation of Liability Provisions. Nothing in the Service Agreement (including these General Terms, and in particular this Section 16 Limitation of Liability provision) shall attempt to exclude liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law. Notwithstanding any provision of the Service Agreement (including these General Terms), if the Customer’s jurisdiction has provisions specific to waiver of liability that conflict with any such limitation of liability provisions in the Service Agreement, then Remotely’s liability is limited to the smallest extent possible by law.  Specifically, in those jurisdictions not allowed, Remotely does not disclaim liability for: (i) death or personal injury caused by Remotely’s negligence or that of any of its officers, employees or agents; or (ii) fraudulent misrepresentation; or (iii) any liability which it is not lawful to exclude either now or in the future. IF THE CUSTOMER IS A RESIDENT OF A JURISDICTION THAT REQUIRES A SPECIFIC STATEMENT REGARDING RELEASE THEN THE FOLLOWING APPLIES.  FOR EXAMPLE, CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS MUST, AS A CONDITION OF THIS AGREEMENT, WAIVE THE APPLICABILITY OF CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542, WHICH STATES, “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.&ldquo;  THE CUSTOMER WAIVES THIS SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE, AND WAIVES ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN LAW, REGULATION, OR CODE THAT HAS THE SAME INTENT OR EFFECT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RELEASE.</p></li>
<li><p>Customer Release. THE CUSTOMER AGREES THAT THE CUSTOMER IS RELEASING REMOTELY AND THE REMOTELY RELATED PARTIES FROM ANY LIABILITY THAT REMOTELY AND/OR THE REMOTELY RELATED PARTIES MAY OTHERWISE HAVE TO YOU IN RELATION TO OR ARISING FROM THE SERVICE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THESE GENERAL TERMS) OR THE REMOTELY SERVICE, FOR THE ABOVE-STATED REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FAILURE OF REMOTELY’S SERVICE, NEGLIGENCE, OR ANY OTHER TORT.  TO THE EXTENT THAT APPLICABLE LAW RESTRICTS THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY, THE CUSTOMER AGREES THAT REMOTELY AND/OR THE REMOTELY RELATED PARTIES ARE ONLY LIABLE TO THE CUSTOMER FOR THE MINIMUM AMOUNT OF DAMAGES THAT THE LAW RESTRICTS OUR LIABILITY TO, IF SUCH A MINIMUM EXISTS. THE PROVISION OF THE REMOTELY SERVICE TO THE CUSTOMER IS CONTINGENT ON THE CUSTOMER’S AGREEMENT WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 16 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY AND ALL OTHER SECTIONS OF THE SERVICE AGREEMENT (INCLUDING THESE GENERAL TERMS).</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Indemnity.</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Customer’s Indemnity. The Service Agreement is intended for only Customer’s benefit, and any benefits of and rights to the Remotely Service inuring to the Customer’s Residents in the applicable Rental Communities pursuant to the Service Agreement are expressly limited as set forth in Section 13(b) of these General Terms. Therefore, the Customer agrees to protect/indemnify, hold harmless, defend (if requested by Remotely) and release Remotely and the Remotely Related Parties from any liability, and shall reimburse Remotely and the Remotely Related Parties for any damages, losses or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs and disbursements) incurred by Remotely or the Remotely Related Parties in connection with any claims, suits, judgments and causes of action which relate to the Service, the System, the App and/or the Site. This protection/indemnity includes claims brought by any third party, including, without limitation, any of the Customer’s Residents in any of the applicable Rental Communities, or the Customer’s insurance company, whether the claim arises under contract, warranty, negligence, or any other theory of liability. The Customer agrees that the Customer has a duty to defend Remotely and the Remotely Related Parties against any such claims, and Remotely may require the Customer to pay for an attorney(s) of Remotely’s choice in such cases. The Customer further acknowledges and agrees that Remotely may elect to settle with the party/parties making the claim, and the Customer shall be liable for the damages as though the claim had proceeded to trial. The CUSTOMER’S DUTY TO PROTECT/INDEMNIFY REMOTELY APPLIES EVEN IN THE CASE OF REMOTELY’S OWN NEGLIGENCE.</p></li>
<li><p>Exclusion from Customer’s Indemnity. The Customer’s duty to protect/indemnify Remotely hereunder, however, does not apply to claims based on injuries to third parties or to their property that occur while Remotely&rsquo;s employees or agents were on the applicable Rental Communities and which were caused solely and directly by those Remotely employees or agents.</p></li>
<li><p>Waiver of Subrogation. IN CASE OF ANY THIRD PARTY CLAIM OR LOSS COVERED BY THE CUSTOMER’S INSURANCE, THE CUSTOMER AGREES NOT TO LOOK TO REMOTELY OR THE REMOTELY RELATED PARTIES FOR REIMBURSEMENT. THE CUSTOMER WAIVES ANY RIGHTS THAT THE CUSTOMER’S INSURANCE CARRIER OR OTHERS CLAIMING THROUGH THE CUSTOMER MAY HAVE AGAINST REMOTELY OR ANY REMOTELY RELATED PARTY, INCLUDING ANY RIGHTS OF SUBROGATION.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Insurance.</strong></p>

<p>The Customer is responsible for obtaining all insurance coverage that the Customer believes is necessary to protect the Rental Communities, and their respective business, fixtures, equipment, and possessions, as well as persons in or on said Rental Communities, including coverage for personal injury and property damage. THE PAYMENTS THE CUSTOMER MAKES UNDER THE SERVICE AGREEMENT ARE NOT RELATED TO THE VALUE OF THE RENTAL COMMUNITIES, THE CUSTOMER’S FIXTURES, EQUIPMENT, AND POSSESSIONS, OR THE PERSONS OCCUPYING OR AT ANY TIME PRESENT IN OR ON SAID RENTAL COMMUNITIES, BUT RATHER ARE BASED ON THE COST OF THE SYSTEM AND THE SERVICES, AND TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROTECTIONS AFFORDED TO REMOTELY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT. The Customer hereby releases Remotely and the Remotely Related Parties from any liability for any event or condition customarily covered by commercial property owner’s general liability, property and/or business insurance, as applicable.

If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of the Service Agreement (including of these General Terms), or any portion thereof, to be unenforceable, that provision of the Service Agreement (and/or these General Terms) shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of the Service Agreement (and/or these General Terms) shall continue in full force and effect.</p></li>
<li><p>Injunctive Relief.
